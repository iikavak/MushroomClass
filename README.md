----------
In this project, the goal is to classify the mushroom. Data are obtained on the Kaggle website. This time dataset has object variables so first of all we needed the change the data so we could analyze it. According to the data's variable, I try to classify with class variable. I applied label encoder to the dataset. Then I made a decision tree with Gini. The accuracy was 0.9888. After that, I applied entropy and the accuracy was 0.9914. Almost 1.0.
